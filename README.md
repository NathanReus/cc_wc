# Coding Challenge #1 - Build Your Own wc Tool

This is the first in a series of coding challenges that I'm doing from [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/), which I'm doing in Rust to learn the language.

[Challenge #1](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc) is to re-create the `wc` Unix command line utility.
